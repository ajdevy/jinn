 * Declared write provenance for Todo mutations.

 * The gateway authenticates the principal, not the surface: a write issued by a
 * talk tool arrives as the same authenticated operator as a click in the web UI,
 * so without this the audit log cannot tell them apart. A request may DECLARE
 * the surface it came from in `X-Jinn-Origin`, and the work-item write routes
 * fold the declaration into the event they append.
 *
 * It is audit colour, never authority — nothing is granted or withheld on it, so
 * a forged header buys a caller nothing but a wrong label on their own write.
 * Only allowlisted values survive; an unrecognised declaration is dropped rather
 * than persisted, so the header cannot be used to write arbitrary strings into
 * the audit trail.

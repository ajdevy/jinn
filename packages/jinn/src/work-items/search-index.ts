 * Full-text search index over Todos and their comments (ICI-1369).
 *
 * Two external-content FTS5 tables, mirroring `messages_fts`
 * (`sessions/migrate.ts`): the index lives here and the text is read back from
 * `work_items` / `work_item_comments` by rowid, which is what lets `snippet()`
 * serve a per-row match reason. A contentless index could not.
 *
 * Currency is owned by SQL triggers, not by JS call sites — the store has three
 * distinct `UPDATE work_items SET` paths and comments mutate through insert,
 * edit, and tombstone — so every write moves the index inside the writer's own
 * transaction. There is no watermark machinery: `messages_fts` needs one only
 * because the message table is unbounded, while Todos and their comments number
 * in the thousands and seed synchronously.

 * Each object is checked by its STORED DDL, not by its name. A name-only check
 * accepts an `work_items_fts` that is an ordinary table (every later query then
 * fails with `no such column`) and accepts a missing or edited trigger (every
 * write made while it was gone stays unindexed, silently and permanently). Both
 * are corrected here rather than refused at boot, because unlike the ledger
 * tables this index carries no data of its own: it is derived from
 * `work_items` / `work_item_comments`, so the honest response to drift is to
 * rebuild it from the content that is still intact.
 *
 * `rebuild` is FTS5 reseeding itself from that content, so it is idempotent: a
 * migration that finds every shape already canonical rebuilds nothing and
 * leaves index content byte-identical, which keeps boot off a full reindex.

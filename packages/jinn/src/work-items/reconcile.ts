/**
 * Work-item status reconciler (GRS-003a, elevated to the Todos vocabulary by
 * GRS-021a design §1.1).
 *
 * A work item's status is DERIVED from the terminal/recovery states of its
 * linked execution attempts (sessions), not from scattered ad-hoc writes. The
 * elevated rules:
 *
 *   - `done`/`cancelled`/`escalated` are STICKY. Closes are decisions; escalated
 *     is a deliberate routing to the operator — session churn never silently
 *     pulls an item off his queue.
 *   - ZERO linked sessions → untouched (`backlog`/`assigned` are never clobbered).
 *     Attempts older than the operator's own last status move are not linked
 *     evidence at all — see `attempt-evidence.ts`.
 *   - Any session in flight (`running`/`waiting`) → `executing`.
 *   - Newest attempt with an explicit `succeeded` receipt → `in_review` (the vision's "session completes →
 *     in_review, NOT done" made structural) — then the TRUST policy hook runs in
 *     the same pass: an item whose effective verify mode is `trust` auto-closes
 *     to `done` (actor `policy:trust`, event-audited), so cron/fire-and-forget
 *     items never pile into a fake review queue.
 *   - Newest attempt with an explicit `failed`/`interrupted` receipt → `blocked`.
 *
 * All writes go through the guarded `transitions.ts` (event-audited, optimistic,
 * sticky-safe) — the reconciler is a consumer of the state machine, not a second
 * write path.

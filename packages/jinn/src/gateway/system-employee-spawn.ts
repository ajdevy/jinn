 * Can this built-in employee actually run, and if not, which setting fixes it?

 * The Todo Dispatcher and the Todo Shaper ask exactly this before spending
 * anything, and both have to answer with the knob the operator would turn: a
 * system employee that cannot attach the company tools is a session that will
 * burn a turn and achieve nothing, and one whose engine is missing never starts
 * at all. Sharing the answer keeps the two routes from drifting into two
 * different explanations of the same broken configuration.

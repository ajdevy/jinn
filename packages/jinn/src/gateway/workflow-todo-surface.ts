/**
 * What a Todo-bound Workflow run owes the Todo it runs for, implemented once in
 * the platform instead of once per workflow author.
 *
 * Before this, the only reason a bound Todo moved during a run was an author
 * hand-writing `update_work_item` into every phase prompt and wiring a
 * record-failure branch into the graph. One forgotten instruction left a merged
 * Todo reading `assigned`, and a parked gate told nobody at all.
 *
 * Six obligations:
 *   - reflect the run's lifecycle onto the Todo's status
 *   - record each gate decision on the Todo
 *   - record WHY a run settled failed
 *   - wake the routed employee when the run parks on their decision
 *   - send the work round again when that approver rejects WITH feedback
 *   - close a successful run after an operator-only gate supplied the review
 *
 * Completion remains absent for every other path. Reaching a success End alone
 * is not a review; only a recorded operator-only approval supplies the human
 * authority to close without weakening the self-review rule.
 */

/**
 * Whether a reflection is allowed to move this Todo. Sticky terminals need no
 * check — `transition` refuses to leave them without human authority — so this
 * is only about the statuses a phase can deliberately choose.
 *
 *   - `executing` is the START edge, legal only out of `backlog`/`assigned` (the
 *     same rule `transition` applies to a manual start). Anywhere else, a phase
 *     has already said something more specific and keeps it.
 *   - `in_review` yields to a DECLARED block: a phase that blocked with a real
 *     reason says more than "a decision is pending".
 *   - `blocked` always writes. A run that died is the newest and most
 *     consequential fact about the work, and leaving the board on a phase's
 *     optimistic `in_review` is the exact lie this surface exists to stop.

/**
 * `GET /api/talk/config` — what the voice surface needs to know before it asks
 * for a session.
 *
 * The orb has to answer "is voice set up here?" without minting anything:
 * minting is a billed call to the provider, so an operator with no provider
 * configured would be charged to be told they have none. This route reports
 * capability only — the providers the gateway implements, and whether the
 * configured one would actually build. The answer is a boolean rather than the
 * `realtime` block itself so that no shape of this response can carry the key.
 * The voice list is the one piece of provider knowledge it does hand over: a
 * picker needs it, and it is public information about the provider, not about
 * this account.

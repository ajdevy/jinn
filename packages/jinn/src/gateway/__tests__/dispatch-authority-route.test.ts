/**
 * Who may start the Dispatcher on a Todo.
 *
 * PLA-228 rests on the answer: the Todo Shaper creates a Todo and hands it
 * straight on, so quick capture only works if a session has standing over what
 * it created. It does, and by an existing rule rather than a new exception —
 * the approval route resolves an unassigned Todo's owner to the employee behind
 * its source session. That is also why the Shaper's persona forbids setting an
 * assignee: an assignee it wrote would become the owner instead, and the Shaper
 * would lose the Todo it had just made.

 * The stage rules themselves are unit-tested against fixtures in
 * todo-capture-stage.test.ts. What can only be checked here is that the route
 * feeds those rules the TRUE facts — the right session, the right Todos, the
 * link a landing wrote.
 *
 * Both halves of acceptance (d) also live here, because a reason reaching the
 * log is one property with two paths to it: a refusal that is thrown, and a
 * failure that is derived. Testing them apart is how one of them ends up
 * untested. What the POST refuses before it spends anything is
 * todo-capture-route.test.ts.

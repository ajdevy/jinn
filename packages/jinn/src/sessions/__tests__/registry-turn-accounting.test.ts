 * the accounting helper — classic runWebSession/manager.ts drift.
 *
 * This matters beyond reporting: SUM(total_cost) backs employee budget
 * enforcement, and the overwhelming majority of turns are web-sourced, so the
 * caps were effectively unenforced.
 *
 * recordTurnAccounting is now the single entry point both runners share. These
 * tests pin its contract so a future edit to either runner can't silently drop
 * accounting again.

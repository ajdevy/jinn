# Instance migration bundle: 0.31.0 → 0.32.0

<!-- BEGIN RELEASE RATIONALE -->
This release bundle was generated from the exact instance-template delta.
<!-- END RELEASE RATIONALE -->

This file is generated. The manifest is authoritative; each record below appears exactly once.
The payload paths below are generic package sources. Before review, the gateway creates audited, read-only materialized base payload and materialized target payload copies beneath the instance migration snapshot using that instance's exact template replacements.
Perform the three-way merge only from those materialized snapshot payloads and the current user-owned instance file. Never apply a raw generic payload or copy an unresolved placeholder into the instance. Preserve user customizations and never delete user content without explicit review and a snapshot.

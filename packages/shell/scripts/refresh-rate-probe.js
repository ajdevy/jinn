/**
 * Refresh-rate probe for the desktop shell spike.
 *
 * The question it answers: does the shell's webview drive requestAnimationFrame
 * at the display's native rate, or is it pinned to 60Hz the way iOS WKWebView
 * was? The research note behind this spike says macOS 26 lifted that cap. This
 * measures it instead of repeating it.
 *
 * A measured rate on its own cannot answer that, because a 60Hz display and a
 * webview pinned to 60 read identically. So the probe refuses to guess: it
 * compares its reading against the display's own maximum, which the shell
 * publishes as `window.__jinnDisplayHz` (see src-tauri/src/display.rs), and says
 * `indeterminate` whenever the two cannot be told apart.
 *
 * This is not `scripts/frame-probe.js`. That one asks whether a
 * WebView scrolls worse than a PWA, against a fixed 60Hz baseline, on the chat
 * transcript. Here 60Hz is the assumption under test, there is nothing to
 * compare against, and no scrolling is involved — the subject is the frame
 * clock, not jank.
 *
 * Usage: run the shell, open the Web Inspector on it from Safari's Develop
 * menu, paste this whole file into the console, and copy the single JSON line
 * it prints.

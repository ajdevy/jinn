 * Navigations are network-first so a deploy lands on the next reload rather
 * than the one after it, which means the offline fallback lives in a runtime
 * cache — and a runtime cache is only written by navigations the worker
 * intercepted. The navigation that installs the worker is not one of them, so
 * without this an app that has been opened exactly once has no shell to fall
 * back to. Fetching the document here also pins it to the same install that
 * precaches the chunks it references, so the two can never disagree offline. */

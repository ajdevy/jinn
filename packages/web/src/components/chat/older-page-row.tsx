/**
 * The row above the transcript that reports on the older page.
 *
 * It is rendered whether or not it has anything to say. A spinner appearing
 * above a windowed transcript drops everything below it by its own height and
 * lifts it back when the page lands — twice, under a reader who only scrolled —
 * and the anchoring below it works in the virtualizer's offsets, which know
 * nothing about a row outside the virtual block. Reserving the height costs one
 * empty line at the very top and no scroll writes at all.

/**
 * Token counts, and the two sums that keep a voice session honestly billed.
 *
 * The provider reports each response's own counts, while a `turn_done` frame
 * carries the session total after that turn — the gateway's adapter folds one
 * into the other over its socket (talk/realtime/openai.ts) and the browser does
 * the same over its data channel. `POST /api/talk/sessions/:id/turn` then prices
 * whatever it is handed as that turn alone, so the client subtracts the reading
 * before it (docs/talk-session-runtime.md). Posting a total where a delta
 * belongs bills every earlier turn again, and the over-charge compounds with the
 * conversation. Both sums live here rather than inline in the transport: one
 * place to read, and one place to get wrong.

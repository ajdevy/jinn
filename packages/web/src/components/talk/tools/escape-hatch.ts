/**
 * The catch-all: an intent no named tool covers.
 *
 * It is the least predictable surface the orb has — the model reaches it exactly
 * when it has stopped matching a request to something the app can do — so it
 * never gets the fast lane and never acts on its own reading of a sentence. The
 * one thing it can resolve to is recording the ask against a Todo, which is the
 * honest answer to "no tool does this": keep it where it will be seen, and say
 * so out loud.
 *
 * ## The result contract
 *
 * Success is `{ ok: true, data: { performed, subject?, undo? } }` where
 * `performed` is a past-tense sentence the model can say back, and `undo` names
 * the tool call that reverses it, if one exists. Consent given here stands in
 * for the undo, so nothing is offered.
 *
 * Refusal is `{ ok: false, error }` — the operator declining, and the intent
 * this cannot resolve, read the same way to the caller. A write the operator has
 * not agreed to is a refusal, not a failure.

 *
 * Anchoring is off while a card is lifted — the drag reorders the column under
 * the pointer, and correcting for that is fighting the reader, not helping.
 *
 * The same container serves the attention inbox and the grouped board, which
 * identify their rows by different attributes. Anchoring the grouped board only
 * became safe once its cards were given a real `contain-intrinsic-size`: while
 * the estimate was `auto 160px` against a 45px card, the browser revised every
 * skipped card's height as the reader travelled, and a correction measured at a
 * commit boundary chased that phantom to an edge.

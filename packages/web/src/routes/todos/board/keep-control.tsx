/* ICI-1357 — keeping a Todo on Home, and saying whose work a kept Todo is.
 *
 * A pin is how anything the operator did not create reaches Home (PLA-230), so
 * both parts have to be legible from a board they did not pin: the pin says
 * "this can go on Home", and the caption says whose work the kept one is.
 *
 * Both parts are presentational — the mutation lives in use-board.ts with the
 * board's others, and reaches the card as a callback like every other action. */

/**
 * The toggle. It shows at rest wherever it is mounted: an affordance nobody
 * can see is one nobody uses, and hover-gating it hid the whole gesture on the
 * board where it matters most. Unkept it rests at `--text-tertiary`, which
 * clears 3:1 on the card in both themes where the quietest ink measured 1.9:1,
 * and strengthens under the pointer; kept it is the accent, filled. The button
 * occupies the same box in every state, so a card cannot resize as the pointer
 * crosses it.

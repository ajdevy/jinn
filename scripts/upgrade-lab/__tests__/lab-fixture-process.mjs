/**
 * A long-lived child that pretends to be a process the lab must reap, and that is guaranteed to die
 * with the test that made it.
 *
 * The fixture only exits on SIGTERM, and its IPC channel is a live handle on the TEST process. So an
 * early return — a failed assertion, or `node --test` cancelling the test at its timeout — used to
 * leave both alive, and the runner then could not exit. That is not hypothetical: it hung a release
 * for 38 minutes until the CI job budget ran out, with the runner terminating orphans afterwards.
 *
 * Everything here therefore runs the caller's body inside `try/finally` and reaps unconditionally:
 * disconnect the IPC handle first so the event loop is free even if the kill races, then SIGKILL if
 * the child has not already exited on its own.

 * directory you drop files into, so the example needs no account, no network and
 * no credentials to run.
 *
 * Two exports, and the gateway reads exactly these: a default registrar that
 * returns the plugin's routes, and an optional `watcher` the gateway starts and
 * stops. Importing this file must never start anything by itself.

 * function at its seams into named helpers; give the branchy part its own
 * function with an early return per case; hoist a nested loop or condition into
 * a helper so the body reads flat; group related parameters into one options
 * object; await the promise, or hand it to `void` if the result is genuinely
 * not wanted. `eslint-baseline.json` grandfathers code that predates this

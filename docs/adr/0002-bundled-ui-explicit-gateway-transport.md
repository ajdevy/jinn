# ADR 0002: Bundle the UI and make gateway transport explicit

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-18
- Decision owners: platform team

## Context

Loading a gateway URL directly inside a native webview couples application
assets, authentication, service-worker state, and navigation to one server. It
also makes it difficult to prove that an untrusted LAN or remote page cannot
reach privileged native APIs.

## Decision

The native main window always loads `WebviewUrl::App("index.html")`. The same
production web build used by the gateway is copied into the shell before native
packaging. JavaScript reaches gateways only through `GatewayTransport` and a
four-command native bridge: `pair`, `request`, `stream`, and `forget`.

The bridge accepts root-relative paths and an explicit canonical target origin.
Rust owns cookies and WebSocket authentication. Plain HTTP is restricted to
literal loopback; non-loopback gateways require HTTPS. Commands verify the
calling window and bundled document. Capabilities contain no remote grants.

External HTTP(S) navigation opens outside the application. `jinn://` links are
translated to bundled in-app routes.

## Consequences

- Gateway restarts do not replace the application document or its assets.
- Service-worker and API requests stay same-origin from the web application's
  perspective; native requests never expose credentials to JavaScript.
- A hostile remote page cannot gain native IPC by being loaded in another
  window.
- The production bundle gate scans every emitted JavaScript asset for forbidden
  native framework dependency markers.
